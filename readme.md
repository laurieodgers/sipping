# sipping

A Python class to obtain latency/packetloss metrics using SIP OPTIONS.

This class was brought into being based on the work done on SIPRig
(https://github.com/martincyoung/SIPRig). I had encountered a bunch of SIP
Options ping style python scripts but could not find one which presents as
an actual class.

This is a work in progress.
